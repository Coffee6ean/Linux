# Zone & Work Density Tool -

## Purpose:

The Zone & Work Density Tool is a comprehensive Node.js and React application designed to facilitate engineers in evaluating zones and work density within uploaded maps. This tool empowers users to upload maps, visualize various zones, and analyze work density across different areas. Leveraging Node.js, Express.js, React, and other essential libraries, the application provides a seamless user experience with intuitive interfaces and efficient data processing.

## Features:

- **Upload Map**: Users can upload images of maps or building sites.
- **Interactive Grid**: An interactive grid dynamically adjusts to the size of the map, allowing users to click on each quadrant/box and assign work density levels.
- **Zone Definition**: Users can determine the number of zones and overlay SVG or div components on the map. Zones are leveled based on the calculated work density grades.
- **Edit/Save Processed Map**: Users can edit and save processed maps with defined zones and work density.

## Tools & Technologies:

- **Node.js**: The backend server is built with Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is used as the web application framework for handling HTTP requests and defining routes.
- **React**: React is used for building interactive user interfaces, enabling efficient rendering and state management.
- **Konva**: Konva is utilized for drawing custom shapes, adding interactivity, and handling complex interactions like dragging and resizing.
- **D3.js**: D3.js enhances data visualization capabilities and supports dynamic updates based on user input.

## How to Use:

1. **Upload Map**: Navigate to the upload page and select an image file of the map or building site.
2. **Interactive Grid**: Once the map is uploaded, an interactive grid will be displayed, allowing you to click on each quadrant/box and assign work density levels.
3. **Define Zones**: After assigning work density levels, specify the number of zones you wish to define and overlay SVG or div components on the map.
4. **Edit/Save Processed Map**: You can edit the processed map as needed and save it with the defined zones and work density levels.
