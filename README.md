# Linux Learning and Projects Repository

Welcome to the Linux Learning and Projects Repository! This private repository serves as a centralized hub for documenting and archiving all learning experiences and personal projects related to Linux, particularly utilizing SWL/Ubuntu shell.

## Overview:
This repository is an integral part of the larger 'SpringBoard' repository, designed to track progress throughout my bootcamp journey. While 'SpringBoard' focuses on exercises and bootcamp deliverables, this repository is dedicated to personal projects, tasks, and deepening your understanding of Linux.

## Contents:
### 1. [Learning Logs](learning-logs/)
Explore detailed logs of your Linux learning journey, including challenges, discoveries, and solutions.

### 2. [Projects](projects/)
Discover and contribute to various personal projects related to Linux. Each project folder contains its own README with specific details and instructions.

### 3. [Scripts](scripts/)
A collection of useful scripts, automation tools, and utilities developed during the learning process. Feel free to use and modify them for your own needs.
